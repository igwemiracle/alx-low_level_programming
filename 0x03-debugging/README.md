## DEBUGGING PROJECT
  #TASK 0:
   * Created two files with one containing positive_or_negative() that 
    tests if output is correct when given a case of 0.
  #Task 1:
   * Copied from the main file. Commentted out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code
    that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
  #Task 2:
   * This program prints the largest of three integers
